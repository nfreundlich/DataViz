Questions:
A) What are the average times for completing the OCC? How do they vary based on gender, age, edition?
A') How did the average running times evolve for OCC between 2014-2017?
B) How do the mean times from OCC compare to a similar cathegory trail (UT4M Chartreuse 2017)?

Data sources:
- UT4M: https://ut4m.fr/fr/courses/resultats and UTMB/OCC: http://utmbmontblanc.com/en/page/107/107.html

Data prep:
- Cleaned and concatenated the yearly results; python to clean data formatting issues

The graphs and their interpretation
- Remarks: filters on the right side of the dashboard may be applied for investigation, for all graphs; exact values are presented in the 'Tooltips'

A) OCC 2014 - 2017 Analysis (histogram)
- X axis - duration of the run (15' bins) / Y axis - number of runners in the interval
- Color coding: a main color palette (green/yellow) to highlight the difference between male/female atheletes; secondary color palette (shades ) is used to highlight various age cathegories
- Analysis: consistently more male runners than female runners; male running time is slightly faster than female running time (appx 30' )

A') OCC 2014 - 2017 Average running time evolution
- X Axis: years from 2014 - 2017 / Y Axis: average running time in minutes
- Remark: I chose a line graph for this discreet measure to suggest the evolution of the averages, in a 'trend line' approach
- Analysis: an interesting discovery - the average run times considering all runner cathegories, vary only by 3 min (0.5%) in four years.

B) OCC vs UT4M comparison (histogram)
- X & Y axis: similar to A) graph
- Color coding: a main color palette (blue/orange) for differentiating between OCC/UT4M; secondary color palette (shades) for less important differentiation btw cathegories
- Analysis: OCC presents a significanlty higher effort than UT4M (a difference of appx 3h on average)

Conclusion
- This analysis might be useful to evaluate one's expected completion time in a specific competition based on previous experiences (ex in our case: expected OCC after UT4M)
- Further investigation might be possible - adding other competitions to the comparison, considering specific distances, elevation gains, terrain etc.
