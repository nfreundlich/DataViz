              Analysis of OCC trail running competition (part of UTMB @ Chamonix).
              <br>
              Questions:
              A) What are the average times for completing the OCC? How do they vary based on gender, age, edition?
              A') How did the average running times evolve for OCC between 2014-2017?
              B) How do the mean times from OCC compare to a similar cathegory trail (UT4M Chartreuse 2017)?
              <br>
              Data sources:
              - UT4M: https://ut4m.fr/fr/courses/resultats and UTMB/OCC:  http://utmbmontblanc.com/en/page/107/107.html
              <br>
              Data prep:
              - Cleaned and concatenated the yearly results; python to clean data formatting issues
              <br>
              The graphs and their interpretation
              - Remarks: filters on the right side of the dashboard may be applied for investigation, for all graphs; exact values are presented in the 'Tooltips'
              <br>
              A) OCC 2014 - 2017 Analysis (histogram)
              - X axis - duration of the run (15' bins) / Y axis - number of runners in the interval
              - Color coding: a main color palette (green/yellow) to highlight the difference between male/female atheletes; secondary color palette (shades ) is used to highlight various age cathegories
              -  Analysis: consistently more male runners than female runners; male running time is slightly faster than female running time (appx 30' )
              <br>
              A') OCC 2014 - 2017 Average running time evolution
              - X Axis: years from 2014 - 2017 / Y Axis: average running time in minutes
              - Remark: I chose a line graph for this discreet measure to suggest the evolution of the averages, in a 'trend line' approach
              - Analysis: an interesting discovery - the average run times considering all runner cathegories, vary only by 3 min (0.5%) in four years.
              <br>
              B) OCC vs UT4M comparison (histogram)
              - X & Y axis: similar to A) graph
              - Color coding: a main color palette (blue/orange) for differentiating between OCC/UT4M; secondary color palette (shades) for less important differentiation btw cathegories
              - Analysis: OCC presents a significanlty higher effort than UT4M (a difference of appx 3h on average)
              <br>
              Conclusion
              - This analysis might be useful to evaluate one's expected completion time in a specific competition based on previous experiences (ex in our case: expected OCC  after  UT4M)
              - Further investigation might be possible - adding other competitions to the comparison, considering specific distances, elevation gains, terrain etc.
